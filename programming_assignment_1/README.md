Run blocksworld.py with the command:
    python3 blocksworld.py <filename> [-H H0|H1|H2|H3|H4] [-M <int>]

Make sure that the <filename> contains the full path from the current working directory to the desired file.
For example, if the current working directory is ~/Desktop/ and the .bwp file is in ~/Desktop/probs/
then the filename argument would look something like: "probs/example.bwp"

The optional flags are:
    -H: select a heuristic H0-H4, where H4 is the default
    -M: select a maximum number of iterations (positive integer)
